# FreeCodeCamp Survey Form

This project is developed as part of FreeCodeCamp's responsive web design certification, leveraging HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS and component thinking.
BEM methodology is used for class names and Flexbox/Grid for layout. The design is clean, and the layout is responsive.

## My two cents

I heard about TailwindCSS from my fellow bootcampers at Brainstation, and it was in my list for sometime now. I decided to use this project as a way to dive into it and learn more about it. The documentation is very easy to follow and the quick search feature is amazing, you can get to your desired utility classes in the blink of an eye.

At first it appeared to me just like any other CSS framework. However, I discovered that the utility-first approach made CSS quick to write and simple to maintain as my style sheet grew in size. And as I experimented with its configuration and customization more, I became more and more aware of how incredibly powerful and robust TailwindCSS can be.
