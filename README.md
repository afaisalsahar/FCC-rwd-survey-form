## Lessons Learned

I've heard of TailwindCSS and decided to learn it by usign it for this project. I jumped right into it's documenation and started using it. At first glance it seemed just like any other CSS framework. However, as my style sheet gew in size, I found that the whole utility-first approach making CSS quick to write and easy to maintain. And,when I started playing around it's configuration and customization, I could see how incredibly powerful and robust TailwindCSS is.
